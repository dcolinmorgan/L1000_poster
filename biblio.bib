  abstract =      {Statistical regularisation methods such as lasso and
                   related $L_1$ penalised regression methods are
                   commonly used to construct models of gene regulatory
                   networks. Although they theoretically can infer the
                   correct network structure{,} they have been shown in
                   practice to make errors{,} \ie leave out existing
                   links and include non-existing links. We show that
                   $L_1$ regularisation methods typically produces a
                   poor network model when the analysed data is
                   ill-conditioned{,} even if it contains enough
                   information for correct network inference. However{,}
                   the correct structure of network models can be
                   obtained for informative data when these methods fail
                   by using least-squares regression and setting small
                   parameters to zero{,} or by using robust network
                   inference{,} a recent method taking the intersection
                   of all non-rejectable models. As available
                   experimental data sets are generally
                   ill-conditioned{,} we recommend all users to check
                   the condition number of the data matrix to avoid this
                   pitfall of $L_1$ regularised inference{,} and to also
                   consider alternative methods.},
